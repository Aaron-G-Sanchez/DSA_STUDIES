## [Sum of Digital Root - 6kyu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00/javascript)

Description:
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.
