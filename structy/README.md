# Structy problem solutions

A directory to hold my JavaScript structy solutions.

## How it's organized

All problems will be solved at the top of each named file, and the bottom of the file will contain the more optimal solution from the walkthrough if not already done. My solution will also contain a guess on what I believe the time and space complexity is on my problem as well as the time and space complexity for the walkthrough solution.

## Table of Contents
